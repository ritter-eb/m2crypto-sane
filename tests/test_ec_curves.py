    Unit tests for M2Crypto.EC, the curves

    There are several ways one could unittest elliptical curves
    but we are going to only validate that we are using the
    OpenSSL curve and that it works with ECDSA.  We will assume
    OpenSSL has validated the curves themselves.

    Also, some curves are shorter than a SHA-1 digest of 160
    bits.  To keep the testing simple, we will take advantage
    of ECDSA's ability to sign any digest length and create a
    digset string of only 48 bits.  Remember we are testing our
    ability to access the curve, not ECDSA itself.
